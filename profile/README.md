Community Innovations is an organization that was founded with the main goal of creating a network of developers who are passionate about coding and willing to collaborate to create the best products possible. We focus on maintaining and reviving unmaintained repositories of projects that have a great use case and creating new projects that we believe are necessary and beneficial to the community.

## Our Mission

We aim to provide a platform where developers can share their expertise, collaborate, and contribute to a wide range of projects. By reviving and maintaining unmaintained repositories, we ensure valuable software continues to thrive. Our focus on innovation and creating solutions that address real world needs makes technology more accessible and impactful.
